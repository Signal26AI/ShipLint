## 2. Landing Page Best Practices

### 2.1 Above-the-Fold Essentials

**Must-Have Elements:**
1. **Clear headline** - What you do in 5-7 words
2. **Supporting subhead** - Why it matters (benefit-focused)
3. **Primary CTA** - Visible, contrasting, action-oriented
4. **Hero visual** - Product screenshot, demo, or relevant image
5. **Navigation** - Minimal, keep focus on conversion

**Best Practices:**
- Keep essential action above fold
- Don't cram—white space is valuable
- Use directional cues (arrows, visual flow) to guide eye
- Design for actual device resolutions (not your fancy laptop)

---

### 2.2 Visual Reading Patterns

**F-Pattern:**
- Users scan horizontally across the top, then down the left side
- Best for: text-heavy pages, blogs, search results
- Place important info along the F-shape

**Z-Pattern:**
- Eyes move: top-left → top-right → diagonal → bottom-left → bottom-right
- Best for: landing pages with minimal text
- Place logo top-left, CTA top-right or bottom-right

**Gutenberg Diagram:**
- Primary optical area (top-left) → strong fallow area (top-right)
- Weak fallow area (bottom-left) → terminal area (bottom-right)
- Users naturally end at bottom-right—put CTA there

---

### 2.3 CTA Psychology

**Color Psychology:**
- Red: Urgency, excitement (good for limited-time offers)
- Green: Safety, "go" signal (good for sign-ups)
- Blue: Trust, security (good for financial products)
- Orange: Enthusiasm, action (high-converting for CTAs)
- Contrast matters more than specific color—CTA must pop

**CTA Copy Best Practices:**
- Action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Try", "Discover"
- Value-focused: "Get Free Report" > "Submit"
- Reduce friction: "Start free trial" > "Buy now"
- Add urgency when appropriate: "Start your free trial today"

**Placement:**
- Above fold (always)
- After key benefit sections
- Floating/sticky CTAs for long pages
- End of page (for scrollers)

---

### 2.4 Social Proof Placement

**Types of Social Proof:**
1. **Customer logos** - "Trusted by" section near hero
2. **Testimonials** - With photos, names, titles (humanize)
3. **Numbers** - Users, revenue processed, uptime stats
4. **Case studies** - Deeper proof for considered purchases
5. **Reviews/ratings** - Third-party validation
6. **Certifications** - SOC 2, GDPR, security badges

**Placement Strategy:**
- Logos: Just below hero or in navigation area
- Testimonials: Mid-page, after explaining value
- Numbers: Hero area or dedicated "proof" section
- Trust badges: Near CTAs to reduce purchase anxiety

---

### 2.5 Page Speed Requirements

**Benchmarks:**
- < 3 seconds load time (53% of mobile users abandon slower sites)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- Core Web Vitals impact SEO ranking

**Optimization Tactics:**
- Compress images (TinyPNG, WebP format)
- Lazy-load below-fold content
- Use CDN for global delivery
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Browser caching for return visitors
- Consider AMP for mobile

---

## 3. Design Systems & Principles

### 3.1 Core UI/UX Principles

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Size: Larger = more important
- Color: Contrast draws attention
- Position: Top-left has priority (for LTR languages)
- Whitespace: Isolation creates emphasis
- Typography weight: Bold for emphasis

**The Golden Ratio (1.618):**
- Apply to font size scaling: 16px body → 26px headers
- Use for element spacing and proportions
- Creates natural visual harmony

**Typography Scale:**
- Base size: 16px minimum for body text
- Scale ratio options:
  - 1.250 (Major Third) - Subtle, compact
  - 1.333 (Perfect Fourth) - Balanced, common
  - 1.618 (Golden Ratio) - Harmonious, dramatic

**Spacing Systems:**
- 4px or 8px base unit for consistency
- Margin/padding: 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px
- Component spacing: Follow consistent vertical rhythm

---

### 3.2 Common Design Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too many fonts** - Stick to 2 max (heading + body)
2. **Poor contrast** - Test all text/background combos
3. **Inconsistent spacing** - Use a spacing scale
4. **Tiny touch targets** - 44x44px minimum on mobile
5. **Hover-only interactions** - Mobile has no hover
6. **Walls of text** - Break into scannable chunks
7. **Generic stock photos** - Use product shots or custom imagery
8. **Hidden CTAs** - Make them obvious
9. **Slow load times** - Optimize everything
10. **Ignoring mobile** - Design mobile-first

---

### 3.3 Accessibility Requirements (WCAG 2.1)

**Contrast Ratios:**
- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum (AA), 7:1 for AAA
- Large text (18px+ bold or 24px+): 3:1 minimum
- UI components/icons: 3:1 minimum
- Maximum contrast: 21:1 (black on white)

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- All interactive elements must be focusable
- Visible focus indicators required
- Logical tab order
- Skip links for navigation

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Alt text for all images
- ARIA labels where needed
- Semantic HTML structure
- Form labels properly associated

**Additional Requirements:**
- Don't rely solely on color to convey info
- Provide text alternatives for audio/video
- Allow text resize up to 200%
- Avoid content that flashes more than 3x/second

---

### 3.4 Mobile-First Patterns

**Core Principles:**
- Content inventory: What's essential?
- Simplify navigation (hamburger menu or bottom nav)
- Touch-friendly targets: 44x44px minimum, 8-12px spacing
- Performance budget: Optimize for slow connections
- Scalable typography: 16px base, fluid scaling

**Mobile Navigation Patterns:**
- Bottom navigation bar (thumb-friendly)
- Hamburger menu (saves space)
- Tab bar (3-5 items max)
- Gesture-based (swipe, pull-to-refresh)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320-480px
- Tablet: 481-768px
- Desktop: 769-1024px
- Large desktop: 1025px+

**Testing Checklist:**
- Test on real devices (not just browser resize)
- Check load times on throttled connection
- Verify touch targets are adequate
- Ensure forms are easy to complete
- Test in both portrait and landscape
